+1. Thanks for the bounty. We are a new site and might not have people to answer. If you post on twitter and tag @StackMatter we can re-tweet for you. Also if you tag the authors of people you think might know the answer, it will help. It worked for this question: https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/q/1926/5.

Do you want to loosen the requirements in the question a bit to allow those software recommendations given by Tyberius, as an answer? The benefit would be that your question would be more likely to get featured in HNQ, meaning it could attract far more of the 15 million users across the whole network, rather than the small community we have here. This can be the difference between [a question getting 8000+ views](https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/q/1355/5) vs [only getting 185 views](https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/q/422/5).
